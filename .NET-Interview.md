  1. What is difference between .Net Core & .Net framework?
    - .NET Core is cross-flatform, it can be run on Windows, MacOS, Linux), .NET Framework is a flatform, run only on Windows.
    - .NET Core doesn't support Destop Application, .NET Framework focuses on both desktop and web application and it supports Window Form application and WFP application.
    - Nuget package different.
    
  2. What is Middleware?
    - Middleware is a component in an application pipeline used to handle requests and responses.
    - Middleware can be custom
    - Each middleware component is responsible for invoking the next component in the pipeline or short-circuiting the pipeline. When a middleware short-circuits, it's called a terminal middleware because it prevents further middleware from processing the request
    - The middleware class must include:
      + a public constructor with a parameter of type RequestDelegate
      + a public method named Invoke or InvokeAsync. This method must: return a Task and accept a frist parameter of type HttpContext

  3. Clarify about Authentication - Access token & Refresh Token. How to prevent reload page during users work on application?
  - Tokens are pieces of data that cary just enough information to facilitate the process of determining a user's identity or authorizing a user to perform an action. Tokens will be encode. Toekens can be a JSON Web Token (JWT). 
  
  - JWT is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information beween parties as a JSON object. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/ private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
  - JWTs consist of three parts separated by dots (.) which are: Header, Payload, Signature.
   + Header consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm beging used, such as HMAC, SHA256, RSA. This is Base64Url encoded
    Base64 is a binary to a text encoding schema that represents binary data in an ASCII string format
   + Payload contains the claims. Claims are statement about an entity (the user) and additional data.
   + Signature encoded header, payload and secret, the algorithm specified in the header.
  
  - Access token: when a user logins in, the authorization server issues an access token, which is an credential that client application can use to make secure calls to an API server.
  - Refresh token is a token that lets a client application get new access tokens without having to ask the user to log in again.
  
  4. What is difference between GET and POST in web API?
  - When using GET, data paramters are included in the URL and visible to everyone. However, when using POST, data is not displayed in the URL but in the HTTP message body.
  - GET is less secure because the URL contains part of the data sent. On the other hand, POST is safer because the paramters are not stored in web server logs or the brower history.
  - GET request can be cached and remain iun the browser history, while POST requests cannot. This means GET requests can be bookmarked, shared, and revisited, while POST requests cannot.
  - GET sends data through the resource URL, which is limited in length (1024 characters), while the POST sends data through the HTTP message body, which has no such limitation.
  - GET supports only string data types, while POST support different data type such as string, numeric, binary
