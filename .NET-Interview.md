  1. What is difference between .Net Core & .Net framework?
    - .NET Core is cross-flatform, it can be run on Windows, MacOS, Linux), .NET Framework is a flatform, run only on Windows.
    - .NET Core doesn't support Destop Application, .NET Framework focuses on both desktop and web application and it supports Window Form application and WFP application.
    - Nuget package different.
    
  2. What is Middleware?
    - Middleware is a component in an application pipeline used to handle requests and responses.
    - Middleware can be custom
    - Each middleware component is responsible for invoking the next component in the pipeline or short-circuiting the pipeline. When a middleware short-circuits, it's called a terminal middleware because it prevents further middleware from processing the request
    - The middleware class must include:
      + a public constructor with a parameter of type RequestDelegate
      + a public method named Invoke or InvokeAsync. This method must: return a Task and accept a frist parameter of type HttpContext

  3. Clarify about Authentication - Access token & Refresh Token. How to prevent reload page during users work on application?
    - Tokens are pieces of data that cary just enough information to facilitate the process of determining a user's identity or authorizing a user to perform an action. Tokens will be encode. Toekens can be a JSON Web Token (JWT). 
    
    - JWT is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information beween parties as a JSON object. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/ private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
    - JWTs consist of three parts separated by dots (.) which are: Header, Payload, Signature.
    + Header consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm beging used, such as HMAC, SHA256, RSA. This is Base64Url encoded
      Base64 is a binary to a text encoding schema that represents binary data in an ASCII string format
    + Payload contains the claims. Claims are statement about an entity (the user) and additional data.
    + Signature encoded header, payload and secret, the algorithm specified in the header.
    
    - Access token: when a user logins in, the authorization server issues an access token, which is an credential that client application can use to make secure calls to an API server.
    - Refresh token is a token that lets a client application get new access tokens without having to ask the user to log in again.
    
  4. What is difference between GET and POST in web API?
    - When using GET, data paramters are included in the URL and visible to everyone. However, when using POST, data is not displayed in the URL but in the HTTP message body.
    - GET is less secure because the URL contains part of the data sent. On the other hand, POST is safer because the paramters are not stored in web server logs or the brower history.
    - GET request can be cached and remain iun the browser history, while POST requests cannot. This means GET requests can be bookmarked, shared, and revisited, while POST requests cannot.
    - GET sends data through the resource URL, which is limited in length (1024 characters), while the POST sends data through the HTTP message body, which has no such limitation.
    - GET supports only string data types, while POST support different data type such as string, numeric, binary
  
  5. What is Dependencies Injection?. How many life time does DI support?
    - Dependency Injection is software design parttern, which is a technique for archieving Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. 
    - Dependency Injection (DI) & Inversion of Control (IoC) indicate the same thing.
    - A DI container is a framework to create dependencies and inject them automatically when required it. Lifecycles: register -> resolve -> dispose.
    - A dependency is an object that another object depends on.
    Example:
    
    public class MessageWriter
    {
        public void Write(string message)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"MessageWriter.Write(message: \"{message}\")");
        }
    }

    public class Worker : BackgroundService
    {
        private readonly MessageWriter _messageWriter = new MessageWriter();

        protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
        {
            while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                _messageWriter.Write($"Worker running at: {DateTimeOffset.Now}");
                await Task.Delay(1000, stoppingToken);
            }
        }
    }

  - lifetime services: 
    - Transient lifetime services are created each time they're requested
    - Scoped lifetime are created once per request
    - Singleton lifetime are created fist time they're requested. It will disposed on the application shutdown.

  8. How to enhance the LinQ query?
  
  9. Provide some collections in LinQ
  
  10. What is AsNoTracking in LinQ? Advantage/Disadvantage. 
  - In the Entity Framework-based applications, the DbContext/ Object Context is responsible for tracking the changes done in the objects, so the correct update is done when the SaveChanges() method of the context is called. 
  - When we retrieve entities using an object query, the Entity Framework puts these entities in a cache and tracks whatever changes are made on these entities until the savechanges method is called.
  - AsNoTracking() extension method returns a new query and the returned entities will not be cached or storage of the entities.
  
  11. What is Overide/Overload method?. Provide the example for them.
  - with method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters
  Example:
    int MyMethod(int x)
    float MyMethod(float x)
  
  - with override modifier is required to extend or modify the abstract or vitual implementation of an inherited 
  Example:
    abstract class Shape
    {
      public abstract int GetArea();
    }
    
    class Square : Shape
    {
      private int _side;
      public Square(int n) => _side = n;
      
      public override int GetArea() => _side * _side;
    }
    
  12. What is Async/Await method?
  - async/ await are syntax in Asynchronous programming.
  
  13. What is extension method?
  - Extension method enable extend existing types without creating new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.
  - Extension methods are defined as static methods. Their first parameter specifies which type the method operates on. The parameter is preceded by the this modifier.
  
  Example:
    public static class ToString(this string str) 
    {
      return str.ToUpper();
    }
